To add songs you need to create an 'mp3' directory  in 'static' (add them in a folder which will be their album, you can also add JPG photo).
Uploading songs via website uses simple 'drag&drop' mechanism, which user has to approve by clicking button. To run player start both client and server servers (you know what I mean)/

# Running server
